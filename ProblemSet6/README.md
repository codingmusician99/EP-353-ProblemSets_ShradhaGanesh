### Purpose

The purpose of this problem set is to practice the use of pointers

### Description

Problem Sets 6.1 and 6.2 dealt with Pointers in functions where in 6.1, the pointer in the function was used to adjust range of MIDI values and in 6.2 it was used to initialize all elements to a certain user input value in an array. Problem Set 6.3 dealt with Pointer Arithmetic where you had to use pointers to reverse a user input string.
