###Files Included
* ProblemSet2.1.c
* ProblemSet2.2.c
* ProblemSet2.3.c
* README.md

###Purpose
The Purpose of this Problem Set was to get familiar with the IDE Visual Studio Code and properly program and compile C programs involving printing correctly formatted text and handling variables and data types

###Description
Problem Set 2.1 covered how to use the printf command in C and also helped in practicing the usage of escape commands such as \n for enter and \t for tab. This is intended to properly format your output when you compile your program. Problem Set 2.2 focused on using variables with integer data types while also formatting it specifically according to the instructions. In this particular problem set it was to print the pitch, velocity and channel values of a MIDI Note which can all only be integers. Problem Set 2.3 focused on using variables with float data types to print the frequency and amplitude values of a sine tone, which can all be decimal or float numbers. For each of the problems, I had to make sure that the program compiled and ran smoothly and was formatted properly according to the instructions. 

###Build and Run Commands
To build Problem Set 2.1 use:

clang ProblemSet2.1.c 

To run the compiled ProblemSet2.1 program, use:

./a.out

To build Problem Set 2.2 use:

clang ProblemSet2.2.c 

To run the compiled ProblemSet2.2 program, use:

./a.out

To build Problem Set 2.3 use:

clang ProblemSet2.3.c 

To run the compiled ProblemSet2.3 program, use:

./a.out

###Acknowledgement

I used the .precision page, as suggested in the problem set, to determine placeholders for the variables in the program and also to determine how to specify number of decimal places in a float value. I also used the Markdown Cheatsheet on GitHub to refresh the syntax for Markdown.
