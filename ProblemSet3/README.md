## Purpose
The purspose of this problem set was to get familiar with conditional statements if/else/switch and loops and to further practice usage of operators in C program. 

## Description
Problem Set 3.1 was designed to help practice the operator pow() for exponents. In this application, it was to implement the formula for converting decibel level to amplitude value. Problem Set 3.2 focused on using the switch statement to assign musical notes to a pitch class value from 0 to 11. Problem Set 3.3 focused on using for loop to output all the notes in an octave. I made sure all the programs compiled and ran through CLI.
