### Project Title

Melodizer --> Program to make your own custom melody

### What have I done for my project so far?

I have written code to have my program to currently take in 10 user input integer values and convert them to a frequency value. I have set up the algorithm for the actual sound file and waveform. 

### What have I not done for my project so far?

I still have to figure out how to make the waveform read all of the user input frequencies and create the melody into the sound file. And also further figure out how to make it more expressive, but that's something I will try to incorporate at the very end. 

### What problems, if any, have I encountered? 

I have to figure out a way for the waveform to read and produce each frequency. Right now, I believe it only produces the first entered frequency
