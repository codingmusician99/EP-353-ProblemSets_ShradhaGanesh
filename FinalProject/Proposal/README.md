# Proposal - Shradha Ganesh 

## Title of the Project

Vocalize -> A Vocoder plugin 

## Summary of project

My project is about creating a Vocoder plugin using C programming. 

## Details

This vocoder will have a carrier setting and a modulator setting along with an interface for determining the bands of frequencies. The number of bands will be user-defined. It will also have a Formant stretch setting which will also be user defined. This is to change the fundamental frequency of each of the bands. There will also be an Unvoiced setting so the user can determine how much of the plosives and sibilants will be used in the vocoding. An oscillator setting will also be provided with square, sawtooth, triangle and sine waves. In addition to this a noise oscillator will also be provided. All of the settings will hopefully be user defined. 

## Combining with other course final project? 

No. This will be completely an EP-353 final project

## What will be definitely accomplished within the deadline? 

I will be able to get the actual programming and algorithm for the vocoding process down by the deadline. 

## What may be achieved by the deadline?

I hope to try and get some of the GUI done by the deadline if I can, maybe using JUCE. 

## What will be the BEST outcome of the final project? 

The best outcome would be to have a solid program with the alogrithm and good GUI so that it can be implemented successfully by the user. 

## Next Steps? 

I will need to research more on the vocoder and how it has been programmed in the past. I will need to learn more about creating plugins with JUCE. I will need to learn about how to implement the splitting of the audio into frequency bands and how that can be user defined. All in all, I will need to learn how to implement all of the user defined settings and get the vocoder working properly.
