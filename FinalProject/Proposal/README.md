## Title of the Project

Melodizer -> Program to make your custom-made melody

## Summary of project

My project is about creating a program that will print out a wav file of a user-made melody using C programming. 

## Details

This program will take in 10 integer inputs from the user, between 0 and 127 corresponding to MIDI Note numbers. This will then be converted to frequencies in order to correspond it to pitch. The program will then create a melody and print it out into a wav file which can then be accessed by the user. In addition to just ordering the notes to create a melody, it will choose duration of each note, amplitude and envelope shape. It may also add some cool effects such as reverb or delay to the final file!

## Combining with other course final project? 

No. This will be completely an EP-353 final project

## What will be definitely accomplished within the deadline? 

I will be able to get the algorithm to make the program produce a melody based on the integer values of the user with regards to ordering the pitches. 

## What may be achieved by the deadline?

I hope to also integrate note duration, envelope shape and amplitude or even velocity in the melody generation. 

## What will be the BEST outcome of the final project? 

The best outcome would be to have all of the described elements and also integrate an effect such as delay, flanger or reverb.  

## Next Steps? 

I will need to start thinking about the algorithm for the program to generate the melody and start testing it out to see if it is indeed able to order the values and produce a wav file with the melody. I further will need to research and learn how I can integrate envelope shape, duration, amplitude/velocity etc. in the melody generation. Finally, I will need to test adding DAFx to the code.
