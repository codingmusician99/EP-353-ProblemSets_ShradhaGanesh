### Purpose
The purpose of this problem set was to explore and practice I/O, functions and variable scope in C. 

### Description 
The Problem Set 4.1 covered how to use File I/O by creating a C program that reads the content from one text file and then rewrites the content in a new text file but switching uppercase characters to lowercase and vice-versa. Problem Set 4.2 covered the usage of functions by creating a sumup function and using it to figure out the sum of all numbers adding up to an integer type variable called 'number'. Problem Set 4.3 covered Variable Scope by creating global, local and static local variables (both outside any functions and inside void function as well as main function). Then, you had to increment each of the variables by one and recall the function 10 times to display 10 outputs of each variable.
